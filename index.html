            medical professionals and administrators overseeing the testing process.</p>

        <p class="information-paragraph">If you are asymptomatic, regardless of whether you have been in contact with
            someone who has tested positive, the CDC's guidelines do not require you to be tested. This means that your
            case may have lower priority in the triage.</p>

            and WHO websites.</p>
